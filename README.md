4 player dominoes is a favorite amongst myself and friends. Perfect for cozy game nights near a fire. A total of 4 people play at time. There are two teams with 2 people on each team. When you play, your teammate sits across from you, and on your left and right sides of the board are your opponents. The dominoes are shuffled and 7 are given to each player. Whoever has the double 6 domino places it on the board. Then the next turn goes to the person counterclockwise. The game is played until a player has no dominoes in their hand or if the game is tied. When a team wins, they get points equal to the amount that their opponents have left. In the event of a tie, whichever team counts less total dominoes wins.  

This version of Dominoes is the user playing with three computer players. The game plays until a player on a team places all of their dominoes or until the board forces a tie, or a tie has occured because each player cannot play or match both ends. 

Placing a Domino: You can only place a domino on the ends of the current dominoe board.
